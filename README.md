# GMSS2.0

GMSS2.0 (Ground Motion Simulation System, Version 2.0) is a MATLAB-based software program package for implementing stochastic finite-fault ground motion simulations.
Two versions are provided: namely GMSS2.0-SS and GMSS2.0-MS. GMSS2.0-SS is developed for simulating ground motions for Single-Scenario earthquake events; while GMSS2.0-MS is for Multiple-Scenario events. Users may choose either one to fulfill their specific requirements.

GMSS2.0 is featured as en enhanced software package for stochastic ground motion simulations with finite-fault sources, as it contains an updated corner-frequency and rise time model for genearing synthetic seismograms. Detailed information about these features will be provided here soon...

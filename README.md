# GMSS2.0

GMSS2.0 (Ground Motion Simulation System, Version 2.0) is a MATLAB-based software program package for implementing stochastic finite-fault ground motion simulations.
Two types are provided: namely GMSS2.0-SS and GMSS2.0-MS. GMSS2.0-SS is developed for simulating ground motions for Single-Scenario earthquake events; while GMSS2.0-MS is for Multiple-Scenario events. Users may choose either one to fulfill their specific requirements.

GMSS2.0 is featured as an enhanced software package for stochastic ground motion simulations with finite-fault sources, becuase the author made comprehensive improvements based on previous studies, such as it contains an updated corner-frequency and source duration (also called as rise time) model for genearing synthetic seismograms. Detailed information about these features can be found from the user mannual and the companion papers which have been published on BSSA and SRL (listed below).
